      Hello! My name is Juliann Litzinger. I will be going into my junior year of high school at Rappahannock High School. I just started going there when entering 8th grade, but 
      also went there for kindergarten. For preschool and grades 1st through 7th, I went to a small private Christian school at Ephesus Baptist Church. Right now, I'm in the 
      Chesapeake Bay Governor's School Program through RCC. This year made it a challenge, but I really enjoyed it. I'm aiming to graduate from high school with my Associate's 
      Degree. Along with the Computer Science class, I'm also taking a College Success Skills class which will set me on track for that degree.

      My idea right now is to study major in computer science in college and become a cybersecurity specialist. The reason I wanted to take this class was so I could get an idea 
      of what studying computer science would be like and if I would want to do something like that. I've also thought about studying astronomy, but my main interest right now is
      computers. I haven't really looked thoroughly at colleges yet, but I hope to go somewhere out-of-state.
